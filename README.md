- In Spring ApplicationContext using factory Beans.
- When we create notification system (email, sms, push notification) or when we create Logging systems (Console/File/Remote) or Payment gateways (PayPal/Stripe/Razorpay) or File readers (PDF/Excel/CSV) or Springâ€™s ApplicationContext.getBean(...).
